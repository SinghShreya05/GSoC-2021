<h2>MINERVA DATASET GENERATION</h2>
<p><i>To create/generate OSS License dataset for Atarashi </i></p>

- Codebase: [GitHub](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation)
- Documentation: [Wiki](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2021/minerva/)

Why there is need to generate dataset?
1. To implement any Machine learning/Deep learning algorithm we need a better and bigger dataset of SPDX Licences. Due to the lack of dataset currently, all the 10 algorithms which have been tested on Atarashi are restricted to 59% accuracy. But unfortunately, there exists no such dataset for open source licenses on the web.
2. Advanced Architectures and algorithms such as LSTMs, GRU, BERT, WordNET, etc. require huge volumes of dataset before achieving the ability to outperform the accuracy of even traditional algorithms such as TF-IDF , n-gram etc. 
3. Licenses differ from traditional corpora, because of which 50-60% keywords are similar in any two licences, and if the licences have the same licence heading but different versions, they're around 90% similar.

There was a loose implementation of n-gramming different permutations and combinations of license text paragraphs. Ref: [SPDX-OSS Dataset](https://github.com/hastagAB/SPDX-OSS-Dataset). This method needed further improvement to make the dataset more accurate and realistic.


The main idea was to intially split the licenses on different permutations and combinations of license text paragraphs maintaining sliding window approach and use these existing files as a baseline model for further manipulating and generating texts. Added FOSSology Nomos agent STRINGS.in regex to the files.

### DOWNLOADING RECENT RELEASED LICENSE FROM SPDX RELEASED JSON TO TXT FILES 
SPDX License List is a list of commonly found licenses and exceptions used in free and open or collaborative software, data, hardware, or documentation, and releases are done on a quarterly basis (more or less) at the end of January, April, July, and October. SPDX Licenses were manually downloaded to txt format from [here](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/master/text).
Licenses JSON format can be downloaded from [this](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/master/json)

I worked on a script to download the licenses from SPDX, SPDX-exceptions, FOSSology Database directly to txt format by passing JSON filepath of new release.

Script : [download](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/tree/main/Download-licenses-Script)

For SPDX licenseListVersion: 3.13, files downloaded are : [files](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/tree/main/Original-SPDX-Dataset)

Original FOSSology db licenses : [files](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/tree/main/Original-DB-Foss-Dataset)

### GENERATED FILES THROUGH INITIAL SPLIT
For splliting the licenses, init 

Script : [initial_split](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/tree/main/Script-Initial-Split)

Files : [SPDX](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/tree/main/Split-SPDX-licenses)

Files : [FOSSologyDatabase](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/tree/main/Split-DB-Foss-Licenses)

### GENERATED FILES BY ADDING REGEX TO SPLITTED FILES
For license check and new dataset generation which satisfies each and every condition of regex for a license file, I used string generators through free and open source libraries such as [xeger](https://pypi.org/project/xeger/) , [intxeger](https://pypi.org/project/intxeger/) and whosoever comes lexicographically closer to the existing datasets in our database used with a threshold value being considered so that randomness in string generation of licenses can be kept at minimum. It has to be done lexicographically since relevance to existing datasets is maintained.
